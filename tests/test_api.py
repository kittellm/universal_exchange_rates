"""Basic tests for the ExchangeRateAPI client.

These tests exercise the public API and ensure that the client can
retrieve data from the upstream service.  They are deliberately light
weight so they do not exhaust the underlying service.  To run the tests
simply execute:

    pytest tests/test_api.py

Note that the tests require an internet connection.  They will be
skipped automatically if network access is unavailable.
